    //-   img(src="./img/secec-president-2018.png")
    //-   p I hope you are enjoying the hottest European summer on record, and looking forward to early autumn on Lake Geneva. The 28th Congress will be, as usual, a scientific meeting of the highest quality, and a wonderful opportunity for communication. A return to Switzerland, the home of so many of our contributors and in particular our co-founder Norbert Gschwend, is always a pleasure; and the venue of Geneva is an ideal location as it is a cradle of so many NGOs and an exemplar of what Europe can achieve through active co-operation. Our major theme will be health economics with a focus on how we deliver treatment to our patients, and on how we ensure effectiveness with respect to both outcomes and healthcare costs. We need to evaluate how our scientific output changes our clinical.practice . Once again we have included technology not only for current procedures but also to understand what is available and how it could potentially change our discipline.
